# Frontend Hiring Test - IP Tracker Application (Intermediate)

This test is a part of our hiring process at TuringTech for the Frontend Engineer position. It should take you between 3 to 5 hours, depending on your experience, to implement the minimal version. But we thought about a few bonuses, so feel free to spend some time on them if you want.

*Feel free to apply! Drop us a line with your LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter at hr@turingtechnologies.org.*

## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the IP Geolocation API by [IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

The application can be built using any Frontend Framework/Library such as React, Angular, Vue. We do use React on most of our projects, however, Angular and Vue are also used in some of the projects.

You should try to match the exact design as given in the test resources. Please download the test resources from the link given below.

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
